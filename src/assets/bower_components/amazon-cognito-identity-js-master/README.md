# Amazon Cognito Identity SDK for JavaScript

**NOTE: We have discontinued developing this library as part of this GitHub repository. We will continue to develop it as part of the [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify/tree/master/packages/amazon-cognito-identity-js) GitHub repository. You can still reach us by creating an issue on the AWS Amplify GitHub repository or posting to the Amazon Cognito Identity forums. Versions 1.x will still be available via NPM. Future development will continue on the 2.x versions.**
